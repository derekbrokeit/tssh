# opens a temporary (60 second) tunnel from $center_ip to $ip using $port


port=$1
ip=$2
center_ip=$3
center_user=$4
shift 4

# first, open tunnel
cmd="ssh -q -X -C -c blowfish-cbc,arcfour "
#echo "ssh -f2 -L $port:$ip:22 $center_ip 'sleep 60' > /dev/null  2> /dev/null"
$cmd -f2 -L $port:$ip:22 ${center_user}@$center_ip 'sleep 60' > /dev/null  2> /dev/null
# this establishes a tunnel to local $ip through $center_ip
# this session automatically ends when sleep 60 ends, but is kept open as long as the tunnel is in use
# this ensures that the port is reopenned as soon as the tunnel is disconnected from (or at least in 1 minute)
# error messages and text output are suppressed
