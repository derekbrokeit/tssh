# TODO

  - add multiple central server capability. I currently don't have a
  setup to test this, though. It would require each server to have a
  'central-server-name'
  - perhaps it would be best to automatically check during setup if
  there is a central server. This would be helpful to prompt the user
  for a central server if a port has been given, but no central server
  exists
  - proper error handling
  - both short and long form flags/options
